title: 8th Light Welcome Week Recap
---
I spent all of last week at the 8th Light Chicago office, 

Day 1
In groups, figured out differences and similiriest. Can be huge, or smallest. Lesson: explore smallest things, made me think of debugging. 

Paul's talk:
"Path to mastery" phrase really resonated with me. It's not about the end goal of knowing everything, it's about the journey. It's about constantly trying over and over and walking that path. You will never know everything, but you can remain curious and keep learning. 

Ask for a lot of help, be vocal, it's your responsibility to learn. It's not cheating to ask for help, this is not school. 

Values and Principles - loved seeing certain keywords highlighted in the values. Words like partner, share, opportunities, learn, and empathy. This gives me confidence in my decision to koin 8th Light. 
 
User Manual
I realized I'm not as reflective and as self-aware as I could be. I had a hard time filling out the user's manual. I had a hard time with a couple of the questions and would like to revisit them in the near future to see if I could be a little more clear. 


Day 2:
Started working on the cohort agreement and once again realized I have not spent enough time reflecting on personal goals for this apprenticeship. I need to keep reiterating on this! Maybe create a version of the learning matrix that's more personal, not so technical.

Learning workshop from Doug: realle enjoyed this one!
