title: 8th Light Welcome Week Recap
---
I spent all of last week at the 8th Light Chicago office, 

Day 1
In groups, figured out differences and similiriest. Can be huge, or smallest. Lesson: explore smallest things, made me think of debugging. 

Paul's talk:
"Path to mastery" phrase really resonated with me. It's not about the end goal of knowing everything, it's about the journey. It's about constantly trying over and over and walking that path. You will never know everything, but you can remain curious and keep learning. 

Ask for a lot of help, be vocal, it's your responsibility to learn. It's not cheating to ask for help, this is not school. 

Values and Principles - loved seeing certain keywords highlighted in the values. Words like partner, share, opportunities, learn, and empathy. This gives me confidence in my decision to koin 8th Light. 
 
User Manual
I realized I'm not as reflective and as self-aware as I could be. I had a hard time filling out the user's manual. I had a hard time with a couple of the questions and would like to revisit them in the near future to see if I could be a little more clear. 


Day 2:
Started working on the cohort agreement and once again realized I have not spent enough time reflecting on personal goals for this apprenticeship. I need to keep reiterating on this! Maybe create a version of the learning matrix that's more personal, not so technical.

Learning workshop from Doug: really enjoyed this one! I liked when he broke down the differences between a student and an apprentice. I was definitely coming in with a student mentality, but switching to apprentice gives me a more active role. He said "learning is your responsibility", and I really like the power that puts on us. He also said to make sure to learn from everyone around you, it is very lickly someone near you has just solved or worked ont he problem you are working on, and this is a chance to be helped so that you can then also pass that on. 

Magic juice to all this working the most effective is feedback! Feedback accelerates the process. But remember that feedback is usually about the person giving it, not the person receiving it. Take a second to think about it from the perspective of the other person before reacting to it defensively. This helps build empathy and communication. 

BE ALL IN!

Flow was really cool to learn about and have that tool of when to push yourself and when to step back. It gives me something to use in times of extreme frustration and reminds me to keep practicing something in flow state so that I really learn it. It's not just about reading or doing it once, practice is what makes it really count. 

learn to stand, then learn to fly.

growth mindset and multiple intelligences! keeps me from blocking myself and thinking "im just not good at those problems".

The apprenticeship is about developing habits and a practice that you can carry into the rest of your career. 


DAY 3:
Pair programming code retreat. All kinds of emotions. First I was terried of the problem, and felt really dumb because I was stuck and wasn't able to understand the next step. When I had to navigate I felt really frustrated that I wasn't able to contribute, and I felt like my pair was frustrated because they had ideas and wanted to move faster. I prefered the ping pong method for this problem because my pair would write a test which would give me an idea of how to move forward. And by making the test pass, I could figure out what the next step/test should be. This felt a lot more collaborative, productive, and like I could learn from. With driver/navigator, I was either frozen when I was a navigator, or just typing/listening when I was the driver. I didn't really feel like I walked away with much knowledge there. 


Client stories -
These were great to hear and get some insight into all the different roles that a consultant plays. I really enjoyed one crafter's breakdown of consultants into 4 different types: pharmacist, therapist, nurse, and surgeon. And our cohort added a 5th, coach. These aren't set in stone or anything, but it helps ground the vagueness of being a "consultant".

A consultant is a generalist. Still thinking if this is for me? I thought I wanted to be a specialist. But maybe the hourney to a specialist can start as a generalist, until you find your way into a specialty?
