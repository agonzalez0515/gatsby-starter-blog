title: 8th Light Welcome Week Recap
---
I spent all of last week at the 8th Light Chicago office, learning about the company's values, what it means to be an apprentice, and then a consultant.

A key takeway I had was that I don't do enough reflecting, so one of the main things I will be doing from here on forward is journaling and tracking my progress and goals. And not just technical ones, but personal growth specifically. I had a hard time answering a lot of the questions about how you like to work or how people can help you, where do you see your career in 5, 10, 40 years, and what are your hopes and fears. I think I will get the best out of this apprenticeship if I am more self aware about these things and consistently reflect. I like to revisit them in the next couple weeks to see if I could be a little more clear. 

Some other highlights for each day are below ---

### Day 1

The "path to mastery" phrase really resonated with me. It reminded me that it's not about the end goal of knowing everything, it's about the journey. It's about constantly trying over and over and walking that path. You will never know everything, but you can remain curious and keep learning.

We went over the company's values and principles - I loved seeing certain keywords specifically highlighted in the values, words like partner, share, opportunities, learn, and empathy. These give me confidence in my decision to join 8th Light. 

### Day 2

Started working on the cohort agreement and once again realized I have not spent enough time reflecting on personal goals for this apprenticeship. I need to keep reiterating on this! Maybe I should create a version of the learning matrix that's more personal, not so technical.

I really enjoyed the learning workshop by Doug Bradbury. I liked when he broke down the differences between a student and an apprentice. I was definitely coming in with a student mentality, but switching to apprentice gives me a more active role. He said "learning is your responsibility", and I really like the power that puts on us. He also said to make sure to learn from everyone around you, it is very likely someone near you has just solved or worked on the problem you are working on, and this is a chance to be helped so that you can then also pass that on. 

The most important part to making the most of the apprenticeship and learning effectively is feedback! Feedback accelerates the process. But he also says to remember that feedback is usually about the person giving it, not the person receiving it. Take a second to think about it from the perspective of the other person before reacting to it defensively. This helps build empathy and communication. 

Flow was really cool to learn about and to have that tool of when to push yourself and when to step back depending on where you are in the challenge & skill graph. It gives me something to use in times of extreme frustration and reminds me to keep practicing something in flow state so that I really learn it. It's not just about reading or doing it once, practice is what makes it really count. 

I also really liked the part about growth mindset and multiple intelligences! I definitely had an idea of the type of learner I was and what kind of things I could or couldn't learn. The multiple intelligences idea keeps me from blocking myself and thinking "I'm just not good at those problems" and helps me figure out other ways to approach a problem.

At the end of this day I took away that the apprenticeship is about developing habits and a practice that you can carry into the rest of your career.

### DAY 3

Day 3 was the pair programming code retreat. All kinds of emotions. First I was terrified of the problem (Conway's Game of Life), and felt really dumb because I was stuck and wasn't able to understand the problem or what the next step in the solution should be. When I had to navigate I felt really frustrated that I wasn't able to contribute, and I felt like my pair was also frustrated because they had ideas and wanted to move faster. I prefered the ping pong method for this problem because my pair would write a test which would give me an idea of how to move forward. And by making the test pass, I could figure out what the next step/test should be. At this point I felt a little better and handled my earlier frustration. This felt a lot more collaborative, productive, and like I could learn from. With driver/navigator, I was either frozen when I was a navigator, or just typing/listening when I was the driver. 

In the afternoon we got to hear from different crafters and their clients. It was great to get some insight into all the different roles that a consultant plays. I really enjoyed one crafter's breakdown of consultants into 4 different types: pharmacist, therapist, nurse, and surgeon (and our cohort added a 5th, coach). These aren't set in stone or anything, but it helps ground the vagueness of being a "consultant".

### Day 4

Design! I was excited that there was a whole section dedicated to design. I really enjoyed the presentation and the un/usable products exercises. Most of my interests lean towards the front-end (accessibility, PWAs, design systems), so it was great hearing from people working in this domain. I don't consider myself a designer, but I'm a developer that cares about the parts closest to the user. This exercise also helped me realize I do think a lot like like a "product" person, this probably comes from my experience working at an embroidery and screen printing company where we took custom orders and created a product for them that met their needs and also their budgets. 

On this day I thought a lot about my career path and how 8th Light and the apprenticeship are a part of it. How do I learn new things and become a crafter while also staying strong and growing in my front-end interests?

### Day 5

On the last day we had another great session with Doug, this time about imposter syndrome and personal mission statements. I've been experiencing imposter syndrome for a couple of years now, but I had not taken the time to do reading on it. Learning that there are different types of imposter syndrome was great! I'm able to recognize easier what I'm going through and take actions towards fighting it. I identified with the perfectionist, expert, and natural genius categories, especially the expert one ðŸ˜¬. After discussing imposter syndrome with my mentors and other apprentices, I was able to create a list of some things to do when I'm feeling hindered:

* Medidate
* Keep a list of daily accomplishments to look back on
* Journal
* Be an expert in other things
* And the inverse also works, have another hobby where expertise is also impossible. Realize that being an expert is not the end goal.
* Practice self compassion and treating yourself kindly

These feelings come from a narrative you tell yourself. So stop, take a step back, and check what facts you actually have.

Lastly, this is the __mission statement__ I wrote for myself. It needs work, and as I mentioned I had a hard time with this, so I will keep revisiting and iterating it.

Thank you 8th Light for a wonderful week! And thank you #bees&cheese cohort for sharing, being vulnerable, and being supportive.
