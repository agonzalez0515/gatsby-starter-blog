I'm working on an Electron App that will mostly be used by Windows users. The app is a sidebar that collapses, think the sidebar in VS Code that closes with ctrl+b.
Electron lets you set the size of the window with `setSize`, so at first this felt pretty easy. But then.....it wasn't. The requirements were the sidebar should be docked at the edge of the screen
and it should be the whole height of the screen. I could set the width easily by giving it a set pixel size, but how do I set the height to be the whole screen?
There's all kinds of screen sizes!! I tried 100%, but that didn't work. 

Ok off to Electron documentation we go.

After some search, I find out that Electron has an API for the Screen. This is the magic of Electron, it can interact with your machine!
Using `let displays = electron.screen.getPrimaryDisplay()` I can get the width and height of the screen. So then I use the screen height in setSize and tada!

```

```

show setSize(width, height) example.

another problem - docks to the right because x,y
